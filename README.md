xsri - set the root window background in X

XSetRootImage (XSRI): Fedora's Y2K-era wallpaper setter. Feh can set
the wallpaper too, but it can't specify colors or geometry.

I really appreciate this little program. As far as I know, only Gentoo
packages it anymore, and as such I tracked down the RPM from a Gentoo
distfiles mirror.

Written by Owen Taylor in 2001. I've only modified it to be more git-friendly
and build with recent GTK+ (for the time being).
